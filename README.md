🎮 lifewood-2d-minigame

lifewood-2d-minigame is a modern 2D Snake game generated by Gemini AI in a single HTML file based on a one-shot prompt I crafted using prompt engineering. Developed during an internship within a short timeframe to practice AI prompt engineering skills, the project includes gameplay mechanics, a responsive UI with glowing visuals, and local storage features, all in one lightweight file.

My Prompt:

🎮 ROLE

You are a Senior Game Developer building SNAKE, a 2D arcade-style game in a single HTML file. The player guides a snake on a grid to eat foods, grow longer, and avoid self-collision. The design should feel modern, smooth, and visually engaging—optimized through working CDN libraries for layout and gradients.

---

✅ TASK (short and high-level)

• Build classic Snake gameplay: movement, food collection, growth, and self-collision detection.

• Use local storage for score tracking.

• Implement UI using a centered card layout and Bootstrap (CDN).

• Include subtle glowing gradients using CDN assets only.

• Everything must exist in a single HTML file, HTML, CSS, and JS bundled.
